# Phase-1-Project
## Minnesota Animal Directory

### Overview
Minnesota animal directory is a website that will contain types of animals with a picture to go with it.

Users will be able to put in an animal name, accompanied with a link of a picture of the animal to provide vision evidence of it. When the new animal is submitted, it should populate at the bottom of the list and continue to grow as more animals are added in.

### Functions within the application
The application will pull from the db.json file which holds the animals listed on the page.

The submit button is there to add into the db.json file when submitting new animals.

There is a "Dark Mode" and "Light Mode" button on the upper left hand side. This will allow a user to switch between a different colored format for the page. If a user is reading this page at night, one would use "Dark Mode" to lessen the strain on the eyes for a more comfortable read. "Light Mode" of course would just be the other way around.

A simple hover over was added to the begining title of the webpage "Minnesota Animal Directory" which will load in as black colored text. Once the user has passed over it with the mouse it will change to an orange color.

### Requirements for project
1. Use of HTML/CSS/Js while utilizing db.json file for database
2. A non-redirecting page loads in as a single page
3. Including 3 different callbacks for 3 different event listeners
4. Using Fetch request to get data from db.json file
5. Use of map/forEach/filter to manipulate the api data
